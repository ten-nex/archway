# Archway

Welcome to the Archway repository.

## Overview

Archway is a decentralized platform that supports the deployment and execution of smart contracts.

## Features

- Decentralized architecture
- Support for multiple contract languages
- High throughput and low latency

## Getting Started

To get started with Archway, follow the steps below.

## Running a Localnet

To run a local test network (localnet), you can use the provided script.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/archway-network/archway.git
   cd archway
   ```

2. Run the localnet script:
   ```sh
   ./scripts/localnet.sh
   ```

### Accessing Wallets in Localnet

When running a localnet, you will need access to wallets with sufficient balance for testing transactions and deploying contracts. The default mnemonics for these wallets can be found in the `scripts/localnet.sh` file. Here are the mnemonics for the main wallets:

- **Wallet 1**: `mnemonic phrase for wallet 1`
- **Wallet 2**: `mnemonic phrase for wallet 2`
- **Wallet 3**: `mnemonic phrase for wallet 3`

Refer to the `scripts/localnet.sh` file for a complete list of mnemonics and their corresponding wallet addresses.
