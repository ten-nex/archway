# Cosmos SDK Mint Module Specification

The `x/mint` module is responsible for the creation (minting) of new tokens in the Cosmos SDK blockchain. This module aims to regulate the total supply of tokens in the network by minting a consistent number of tokens. The purposes of these inflationary tokens include incentivizing validators, governance, and funding the ecosystem pool.

## Concepts

The `x/mint` module handles the minting of new tokens at annual inflation rates. It follows a simplified inflationary model:
- **Inflation Rate**: Fixed rate of inflation that mints new tokens.
- **Minted Tokens**: Distributed to the fee collector module to be used for staking rewards, governance rewards, etc.

## State

The state of the minting module consists of:

### Inflation Rate
The annualized inflation rate, which is the percentage increase in the token supply per year.

### Minter
The state object defining the total amount minted so far.

- **Minter**
  - `inflation`: The current annual inflation rate.
  - `annual_provisions`: The amount of tokens to be minted per year based on the inflation rate.

## Messages

There are no message types for the `x/mint` module, as it is a system process that happens automatically during the Begin-Blocker.

## Begin-Block

The Begin-Blocker for the `x/mint` module increases the token supply according to the predefined minting rules based on the inflation rate. It calculates the amount of tokens to mint per block and issues these tokens to the fee collector module.

## Parameters

The `x/mint` module has the following parameters:

- `MintDenom`: The denomination of the token to be minted (e.g., `utoken`).
- `InflationRate`: The annualized inflation rate.

The parameters can be queried using:

- `Query/Params`

## Events

The `x/mint` module emits the following events:

- **mint**
  - `amount`: The amount of tokens minted.
  - `denom`: The denomination of the minted tokens.

## Client

### CLI

The `x/mint` module provides the following CLI commands:

- `query-params`: Query the current minting parameters.

### gRPC

The `x/mint` module exposes the following gRPC endpoints:

- `Query/Params`: Query the current minting parameters.

## Future Improvements

Future improvements to the `x/mint` module may include:

- Dynamic inflation rate adjustment based on governance decisions.
- Integration with other modules for more complex token issuance strategies.
